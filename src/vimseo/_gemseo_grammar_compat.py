"""Restore MRO-based JSON grammar auto-discovery.

The private gemseo fork vimseo used to depend on searched a discipline's whole
``__mro__`` for an auto-discovered JSON grammar file, not just its direct
``__bases__``. Stock gemseo only searches direct bases
(:meth:`.GrammarFactory.__search_file`), which breaks vimseo's deeper
``_IS_JSON_GRAMMAR`` discipline/tool hierarchies (e.g. a grammar file defined
two or more levels up from a leaf class). Rather than restructure those
hierarchies or maintain a gemseo fork, this module patches
:class:`.GrammarFactory` in place to walk the full MRO again.
